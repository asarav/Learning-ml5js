# Learning-ml5js
Projects and tutorials in ml5js that are used to learn about and showcase different aspects of the library.

Because ml5js is still a very new library, they don't have many examples on their site. The accuracy of models tends to be rather low, and the library itself throws many errors when run within a browser.
If one of the examples in this repo extends functionality that is not provided in the ml5js examples, feel free to copy the code and use as you please.

Note: Unfortunately, do not seem to come with the ml5js cdn. I'm guessing it is most likely due to the file sizes of the models. If you want a pretrained model that does not come with the cdn, you will need to grab it from here. https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-data-and-models

If you want to train and save your own model, ml5js offers that functionality.
