# Learning-ml5js
Projects and tutorials in ml5js that are used to learn about and showcase different aspects of the library.

Because ml5js is still a very new library, they don't have many examples on their site.
If one of the examples in this repo extends functionality that is not provided in the ml5js examples, feel free to copy the code and use as you please.
